# Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to help our friend, Steve, whose parents want to invest in some form of stocks. They want to invest in a company called Daqo with the ticker "DQ" and we're here to look through the data and tell them whether or not that's a good idea. After grabbing some data for Daqo and a few other "green" companies we'll dig through and tell them which company would be the best to invest in.

## Analysis

### Analysis of DQ Stocks

After running an analysis of Daqo's stocks for the year 2018 we've found that Daqo's stock dropped about 63%. As a result we cannot recommend to our friend Steve or his parents that they purchase any of Daqo's stock.
