# Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to help our friend, Steve, whose parents want to invest in some form of stocks. They want to invest in a company called Daqo with the ticker "DQ" and we're here to look through the data and tell them whether or not that's a good idea. After grabbing some data for Daqo and a few other "green" companies we'll dig through and tell them which company would be the best to invest in.

## Analysis

### Analysis of DQ Stocks

After running an analysis of Daqo's stocks for the year 2018 we've found that Daqo's stock dropped about 63%. As a result we cannot recommend to our friend Steve or his parents that they purchase any of Daqo's stock.

# Analysis of Other Green Stocks (VBA Challenge)

## Overview

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is two-fold; 

1) To compare a list of "green" companies' stocks for the years 2017 and 2018 and determine a stock that owuld e best for investing.
2) To refactor the code for the original analysis in order to try and reduce the amount of time it takes to run said code.

## Analysis

### Stock Comparison 2017 to 2018

Looking at the group of stocks (pictured below) there are only two companies that managed to have positive returns for both years (RUN and ENPH) with ENPH having the larger growth period in 2017 and just barely missing having the larger return in 2018. Due to these findings I would recommend investing in ENPH over RUN, although buying both would be preferred if they have the money.
